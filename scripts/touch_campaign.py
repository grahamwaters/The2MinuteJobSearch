# As a computer programmer, here are the steps you will need to take to make your automated networking and job hunting solution work:

# Install any necessary libraries and dependencies such as schedule, apscheduler, beautifulsoup, and requests.
!pip install schedule apscheduler beautifulsoup4 requests

import apscheduler
import schedule
import time
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

# Write the code to parse the HTML of the LinkedIn profiles using the BeautifulSoup library.

# Write the code to extract the relevant information from the LinkedIn profiles, such as job title, skills, and experience.

# Write the code to create custom message templates that highlight commonalities between your profile and the contact's profile.

# Use the schedule or apscheduler library to schedule the sending of the template messages to the contacts on your list.

# Implement the function to send a "thank you" message or email after each informational interview.

# Test the script with a small set of sample data to ensure that the messages are being sent correctly and at the appropriate time.

# Debug and troubleshoot any errors that may arise during the testing process.

# Optimize the script for performance, readability and maintainability.

# Once the script is working properly, it can be used on a larger scale and can also be integrated with other tools like google calendar, etc.

# It's important to keep in mind that building a script like this will require knowledge of Python, HTML, and web scraping. If you're not comfortable with these technologies, consider seeking help from someone who has experience in these areas.
