Tips from LinkedIn Learning Instructor/Recruiter Jenny Foss

General Tips
Where do I find them? LinkedIn, Google, through GA grads or mutual connections
Time is money for recruiters. Respond/follow up quickly.
A great recruiter can be an ally to you, and they have every incentive for you to do well in the process, whether it’s an internal or external recruiter
Being ghosted by a recruiter often has nothing to do with you. Why might this happen? Feedback from the client is slow, they are still gauging excitement from the rest of the team, they have other project priorities, there’s internal candidate interest, a change in job scope, or they are no longer with the company. If you are ghosted, follow up asking about the next steps. If they do not respond, call them. Work on other opportunities in the meantime. Send one final email before moving on.

Conversations with Internal Recruiters:
Hi, I noticed your job posting and I think I might be a good match. May I ask you a couple of quick questions?
What’s your process?
How often should we communicate?
How do you prefer I communicate with you?
Realistically, how strong of a candidate am I?
Who will I be interviewing with, and what can I expect?
What's the format of the interview?
Do you have tips on how to put my best foot forward?
What do you recommend I bring or prepare?
What’s the dress code?

Conversations with External Recruiters:
Hi, I'm a X and noticed your firm represents clients in my field. I wonder if it makes sense for us to chat?

Do NOT ask/say:
"I'd like to add you to my professional network on LinkedIn."
How many people are interviewing?
How do I stack up against the competition?
Can you pull a few strings for me?

When your recruiter isn’t a good fit (source)
“Whatever the case may be, if you're feeling like it's just not happening between the two of you, you don't have to feel like you're stuck with that person. And in fact, that could really hinder your progress if you do. Instead, I recommend that you respond. And I would follow along with these steps.
Number one, just be honest with them and upfront, but not combative. Maybe you let them know how you're feeling. "Hey, I really appreciate your interest in me, "but I feel like maybe something's not clicking. "Are you feeling the same way?"
Number two, share a little bit of constructive feedback, and give 'em an opportunity to respond. If they're open to that feedback and able to course correct, you've solved your problem right there.
Now, sometimes you're feeling like you're really stuck. What do you do then? What I would do then, is call the main office of that recruiting agency and ask for the branch manager. When you get on the phone, I would say something like, "Look, I'm really excited to be working with you guys, "but I feel like maybe I don't have the right recruiter "for me, and here's why. "What do you recommend I do?" I can guarantee you that if that branch manager feels like you're a good fit for the clients that they're working with, they're going to figure out a solution really fast, whether that's have a conversation with that recruiter or assign you elsewhere. Now I recognize, it's probably not going to be a lot of fun to have these conversations. But what is worse? Do you want to feel like you're stuck with somebody who is not going to be supportive to your job search? Or have a constructive conversation that might help you resolve things fairly quickly, and bring that person back on board as your ally or get somebody else who's going to help you take this the distance.”
