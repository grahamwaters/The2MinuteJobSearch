Example (DSI)
Subject: GA DSI alum seeking your advice
Dear Mr. Jay,
My name is Lucy Carroll and I recently completed the Data Science Immersive bootcamp at General Assembly. I read your blog article on Medium.com and was very impressed with your your approach to solving business problems using data and your job search advice. I am currently researching different careers in the tech industry and would really appreciate your insights as a fellow bootcamp graduate. May I have a few minutes to ask you about your experience at XYZ company?
Best regards,
LucyLinkedIn/Portfolio (URL)
NOTE: Don’t use acronyms like GA, DSI when reaching out to people who are not General Assembly alumni. 

To be safe it’s better to mention the full-form of any acronyms in your communication and job search materials. Unless, it’s a commonly used term in the industry e.g. SQL

Track
Use 3B7 method for top 5 target employers
Set two reminders in your calendar anytime you sent an email to a new contact - #1 3 business day later, #2 7 business days later
If you receive a response before the first reminder, schedule an informational interview ASAP
If no response within 3 business days (i.e. before the first reminder), initiate outreach to second contact at the company
If no response is received before reminder #2 appears, follow up with the original contact
