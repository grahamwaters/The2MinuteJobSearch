# Overview
As a career coach, I think these are all great ideas for incorporating automation into your job hunting and networking efforts. Here are some steps you can take to create an automated solution for networking and job hunting using Python:

Research and understand the process of informational interviews and the importance of doing homework on the company before reaching out.

Develop a system for tracking and organizing your contacts based on their level of connection to you (e.g. in-person vs. remote) and the value of the relationship.

Create a script that takes in a list of names and LinkedIn profile URLs and parses the HTML to extract relevant information such as job title, skills, and experience.

Use this information to create custom message templates that highlight commonalities between your profile and the contact's profile.

Use a library such as schedule or apscheduler to schedule the sending of the template messages to the contacts on your list.

Use the library like beautifulsoup to extract the information of the LinkedIn profile.

Implement a function to send a "thank you" message or email after each informational interview.

Test the script with a small set of sample data to ensure that the messages are being sent correctly and at the appropriate time.

Remember that, networking is a process and the goal of networking is not to "do networking" but to become part of the network. And, it's also important to keep in mind that automation should be used to assist you in your job search, not to replace the personal touch and relationship building that is essential to networking.

# Coding
As a computer programmer, here are the steps you will need to take to make your automated networking and job hunting solution work:

Install any necessary libraries and dependencies such as schedule, apscheduler, beautifulsoup, and requests.

Write the code to parse the HTML of the LinkedIn profiles using the BeautifulSoup library.

Write the code to extract the relevant information from the LinkedIn profiles, such as job title, skills, and experience.

Write the code to create custom message templates that highlight commonalities between your profile and the contact's profile.

Use the schedule or apscheduler library to schedule the sending of the template messages to the contacts on your list.

Implement the function to send a "thank you" message or email after each informational interview.

Test the script with a small set of sample data to ensure that the messages are being sent correctly and at the appropriate time.

Debug and troubleshoot any errors that may arise during the testing process.

Optimize the script for performance, readability and maintainability.

Once the script is working properly, it can be used on a larger scale and can also be integrated with other tools like google calendar, etc.

It's important to keep in mind that building a script like this will require knowledge of Python, HTML, and web scraping. If you're not comfortable with these technologies, consider seeking help from someone who has experience in these areas.
