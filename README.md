The method Dalton lays out in his book is a great way to get started with a job search. It's a simple, straightforward process that can be completed in a few hours. The method is also very flexible, allowing you to customize it to your needs.
This repository contains a Python implementation of the method using Pandas.

## Getting Started

---

### Prerequisites
You will need the following installed on your machine:
- Python 3.9.6
- Pandas
- os
- datetime
- requests
- re
- bs4


### Installing

Clone the repository to your local machine:
```
git clone
```

## Usage

1. Create a new folder for your job search. This folder will contain all of the files you create during your job search.
2. Generate your LAMP List. This list will contain all of the companies you want to work for. You can use the LAMP List Generator to generate your list.

## How to Begin Your Job Search

Let's start by creating a pandas dataframe that matches the template Dalton provides. This is included in this repo's data folder and is named 'template_dalton.xlsx'. We will use this template to create our own dataframe.

Dalton provides compelling evidence for why randomly applying for jobs online is a “fool’s errand.” Dalton references a study of hiring at the New York Federal Reserve in which 12 out of every 13 jobs posted were filled through internal referrals rather than online applicants. Every career coach and nearly all successful job seekers will confirm that targeted networking is the key to securing your next job.. Additionally, many readers will appreciate the concrete approaches for networking processes, which can elude even the most personable, self-aware job seekers. His rational, flow-chart-like style eliminates the guess work and also tempers emotional decision-making and feelings of rejection. Darden’s Alumni Career Services 5-step job search model, and the steps in which the 2-hour job search frameworks apply, is depicted below.. It would be difficult to successfully execute the “Contact” and “Convince” stages of the 2-hour job search approach if you are unclear about what you are looking for. If reaching out to potential employers feels awkward and overwhelming, The 2-Hour Job Search can help you start moving forward [1](https://blogs.darden.virginia.edu/careercorner/2021/03/18/the-2-hour-job-search-can-this-method-work-for-you/).




# Outline of the 2-Hour Job Search Method

1. Identify 10 companies you want to work for. This is your LAMP List. Generate your LAMP List using the LAMP List Generator.

2. Go to the company's website and identify the hiring manager's name. This can be done by searching for the company's "Careers" page or by searching for the company's "About Us" page. Once you have the hiring manager's name, make a note of it.

3. Go to LinkedIn and search for the hiring manager's name. If the hiring manager's name is not on LinkedIn, go to the company's website and search for the hiring manager's name. Once you have the hiring manager's name, make a note of it.

4. Go to the hiring manager's LinkedIn profile and add them as a connection.

5. Send a personalized message to the hiring manager. The message should be personalized to the hiring manager and should include the following:
    - A reference to a mutual connection
    - A reference to a mutual group
    - A reference to a mutual company
    - A reference to a mutual school
    - A reference to a mutual interest

6. Send a follow-up email to the hiring manager. The email should be personalized to the hiring manager and should include the following:
    - A reference to a mutual connection
    - A reference to a mutual group
    - A reference to a mutual company
    - A reference to a mutual school
    - A reference to a mutual interest
    - A reference to a previous conversation

7. Send a follow-up email to the hiring manager. The email should be personalized to the hiring manager and should include the following:
    - A reference to a mutual connection

    - A reference to a mutual company
    - A reference to a mutual school
    - A reference to a mutual interest
