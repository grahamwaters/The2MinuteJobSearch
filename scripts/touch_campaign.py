# Implement the function to send a "thank you" message or email after each informational interview.
# Test the script with a small set of sample data to ensure that the messages are being sent correctly and at the appropriate time.
# Debug and troubleshoot any errors that may arise during the testing process.
# Optimize the script for performance, readability and maintainability.
# Once the script is working properly, it can be used on a larger scale and can also be integrated with other tools like google calendar, etc.
# It's important to keep in mind that building a script like this will require knowledge of Python, HTML, and web scraping. If you're not comfortable with these technologies, consider seeking help from someone who has experience in these areas.
